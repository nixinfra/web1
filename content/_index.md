## 1. The Importance of Network and System Infrastructure


### 1.1. No System, No service. No Network, No connection.

Every click, every application, every AI model – all rely on a foundation that most people tend to overlook.  
System and Network infrastructure is not just a part of IT, it is the core that enables every other field to be possible.  
From the data center to the cloud platform, from AI reasoning to IoT devices – nothing can operate without a solid backbone.  
Here, we build, refine, and advance it with you.


### 1.2. No basics, No advance.

Everyone is chasing the next great thing – AI, cloud computing, automation, whatever is coming next.  
But to stand firm and thrive in this ever-demanding era, you need to understand the fundamentals – the systems, the networking, the very platform everything is built upon.  
The deeper you understand the basics, the further you can advance.  
No solid foundation, no long-term progress.
